 # üì¶ turtlebot_controller

## üìñ Introduction

`turtlebot_controller` is a ROS Noetic package designed to control the `turtlesim` robot through custom C++ nodes. The package includes:

- **`turtle` class**: This class provides methods to move the robot to specific positions without using the pen and also offers functionality for aligning the robot to a target and drawing straight lines.
- **`draw` class**: This class includes methods to draw certain shapes while considering the window's limits.

This package is designed for **ROS Noetic** running on **Ubuntu 20.04** and is useful for learning about ROS publishers, subscribers, actions, and the control of a simple robot.
